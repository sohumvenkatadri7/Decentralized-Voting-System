# Build Warnings - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Issue
You were seeing these warnings:
```
WARNING: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './contracts/contract-address.json'
WARNING: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './contracts/VotingSystem.json'
```

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

I've fixed this by:

1. **Created placeholder contract files** in `src/contracts/`:
   - `contract-address.json` - Placeholder contract address
   - `VotingSystem.json` - Placeholder ABI

2. **Updated web3Utils.js** to handle missing contracts gracefully

3. **These files will be automatically replaced** when you run:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   npm run deploy
   ```

## What This Means

### Before Deployment:
- ‚úÖ App builds without warnings
- ‚úÖ Placeholder files prevent webpack errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Contract functionality won't work (expected)

### After Deployment:
- ‚úÖ Real contract files replace placeholders
- ‚úÖ Full functionality enabled
- ‚úÖ No code changes needed

## Next Steps

1. **Compile the smart contract:**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

2. **Start Ganache** (if not already running)

3. **Deploy the contract:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. **The placeholder files will be replaced with real contract data**

## Verification

After deployment, check that these files were updated:
- `src/contracts/contract-address.json` - Should have real address (not 0x000...)
- `src/contracts/VotingSystem.json` - Should have full ABI array

---

**Note:** The warnings were harmless and expected before deployment. They're now eliminated! üéâ
