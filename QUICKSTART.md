# Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 0: First Build (30 seconds)
The app will build successfully even before deploying the contract. Placeholder files prevent any warnings.

```powershell
npm start
```

You can start the dev server now to see the UI, but you'll need to deploy the contract for full functionality.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (1 min)
\`\`\`powershell
npm install
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Start Ganache (1 min)
1. Open Ganache application
2. Click "Quickstart" or create new workspace
3. Note the RPC Server URL (should be http://127.0.0.1:7545)

### Step 3: Deploy Smart Contract (1 min)
\`\`\`powershell
npm run compile
npm run deploy
\`\`\`

**Expected Output:**
\`\`\`
Deploying VotingSystem contract...
VotingSystem deployed to: 0x... (contract address)
Contract address and ABI saved to src/contracts/
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Configure MetaMask (1 min)
1. Add Ganache Network:
   - Network Name: **Ganache**
   - RPC URL: **http://127.0.0.1:7545**
   - Chain ID: **1337**
   - Currency: **ETH**

2. Import Accounts:
   - Copy private key from Ganache (click key icon)
   - MetaMask ‚Üí Import Account ‚Üí Paste key
   - Import 2 accounts (admin & voter)

3. Set Admin Address:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Run: \`localStorage.setItem('adminAddress', 'YOUR_FIRST_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS')\`

### Step 5: Start Application (1 min)
\`\`\`powershell
npm start
\`\`\`

Application opens at: **http://localhost:3000**
